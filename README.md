# lightning-simulation

## Overview
This C++ SFML 2.5.1 application is an experiment project in simulating air pressure and (TODO) lightning strikes. In physics model used in this application, lightning strike goes through areas with small resistance, and in turn ionizes air (lowers resistance) and creates areas of high pressure. Different resistance air masses are mixed by wind.
